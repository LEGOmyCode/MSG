Invaders

Move user with left and right arrow keys
shoot laser with up arrow key

Avoid Invaders
Destroy all Invaders before they land

/_ Functionality issues _/

- Laser travels through the invaders and doesn't stop upon impact
- Need to keep track of invaders destroyed and create a point system
- display a Win screen
- maybe use better code like 'containers' such that I can use div in my html and do more to the cite rather than referencing all divs in java as my 'battlefield'

/_ Improvement possibilities _/

- Have invaders shoot back
- create a home, author, credits navigation bar
- style better
- add music
